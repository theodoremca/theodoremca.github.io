        question: "How long does it take to build a website?",
        answer: `
            It takes approximately 6-10 weeks to build a website from 
            start to finish, providing we have all the information from you. 
            Our full web design process is broken down here. Generally speaking, 
            the website will only take a long time if we are still waiting for text and images from yourself`,

        question: "What will you need from me?",
        answer: `
          It really depends on what type of website you want. 
          We’ll be able to discuss this on our discovery call before we start working together. 
          Depending on which package we agree on we could need…
          
          Images of you and your team
          Images of your workplace
          Content for the website e.g. text, PDFs etc
          Staff Profiles
          Any Videos you would like adding to the website
          Login details to your existing website
          Some of this might already be on the existing website, in which case it can be transferred over to the new site.`,

        question: "What if I don’t like the website?",
        answer: `
          You’re in luck. We offer a risk-free guarantee. 
          Before we build your new website, we’ll design a mockup of your homepage. 
          We’ll design a layout in Photoshop first, that way you’ll get to see our 
          initial designs within approximately ten days. This is your opportunity to give us 
          feedback and if you really don’t like it, you don’t have to move forward. Best part is, 
          this won’t cost you anything.`,
