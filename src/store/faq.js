        question: "How long does it take to build a website?",
        answer: `
            Approximately, it takes 6 to 10 weeks to build a website from 
            start to finish, provided I have all your information for production. 
            My full web design process is broken down here. Generally speaking, 
            Your website will only take a long time if I'll be waiting for text and images from you`,

        question: "What will you need from me?",
        answer: `
          It really depends on what type of website you want. 
          We’ll be able to discuss this on our discovery call before we start working together. 
          Depending on which package we agree on we could need…
          
          Images of you and your team,
          Images of your workplace,
          Profiles.
          Contents for your website e.g. text, PDFs e.t.c,
          Any Videos you would like to add,
          Login details to your existing website,
          Some of this might already be on the existing website, 
          in which case it can be transferred over to your new site.`,

        question: "What if I don’t like the website?",
        answer: `
          You’re in luck. I offer a risk-free guarantee. 
          Before I build your new website, I’ll design a mockup of your homepage. 
          I’ll design a layout in Figma first, that way you’ll get to see my 
          initial designs within approximately ten days. This is your opportunity to give me 
          feedback and if you really don’t like it, you don’t have to move forward. Best part is, 
          this won’t cost you anything.`,
